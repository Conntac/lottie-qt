 @param startKeyFrame When the block is called, startFrame is the most recent keyframe for the keypath in relation to the current time.
 @param endKeyFrame When the block is called, endFrame is the next keyframe for the keypath in relation to the current time.
 @param interpolatedProgress A value from 0-1 that represents the current progress between keyframes. It respects the keyframes current easing curves.
 @param startColor The color from the previous keyframe in relation to the current time.
